In this project, I created the famous Tic Tac Toe game using python. This is a simple project that doesn't require any library, meaning that is pure python language. A project as such is quite nice to learn and enhance my programming skill, with functions and "if" statements.

The script is well commented and suited for anyone who wants to follow along.
